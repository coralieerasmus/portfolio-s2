                            In these two projects I had to work in teams, where we had to do everything together. From planning to task division, 
                            while also maintaining clear communication with eachother. And in both of these teams that I have worked in
                            I can say they have both been successful. I think this is because in both everyone had some of their ideas implemented in the final product and 
                            and everyones opinions were respected and discussed between all members. An example of this is when choosing to cut

                                I would frequently ask teachers for feedback on my codes to make sure I was on the right track, and would take the feedback 
                                I received from teachers and some students and add those into the project.
