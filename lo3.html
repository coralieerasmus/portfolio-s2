                        I analyzed competitors' websites to inform design decisions and aligned the new layout with industry standards. 
                        I chose a sailing company from my home country with an outdated website and crafted a new design emphasizing clarity and cleanliness. 
                        To reflect the company's sailing activities, I used relevant pictures and created a wavy design for sections with more text.
                         Important elements like the tours section were displayed with clear call-to-action buttons such as “Book now!” and “Learn more.”<br><br>
                        
                        Branding Project with Figma<br><br>
                        We began with <span class="highlight" id="highlight2">individual moodboards</span> and <span class="highlight" id="highlight3">brand guides</span>, exploring simplistic and uninspiring design prototypes. 
                        After receiving feedback, I proposed a transformative new design that received unanimous team approval and perfectly 
                        aligned with the client’s brand identity. This design was even used by the client for her business cards.<br><br>
                        
                        Portfolio Development<br><br>
                        I experimented with different styles inspired by the ocean and simplicity before finalizing a design based on my 
                        country's history. I incorporated symbols from native Indian and Arawak tribe paintings found in Aruba’s caves and
                         created a vision board to guide the design process. After finalizing the aesthetic, I began designing, ultimately 
                         adding some color to enhance the design.</p>

                    <p>Redesigning a stagnant company website resulted in a layout that aligned with industry standards and 
                        provided a more user-friendly experience. The branding project with Figma allowed me to develop an interactive 
                        website mockup that perfectly matched the client’s brand identity, receiving positive feedback from stakeholders. 
                        My portfolio development involved an iterative design process and incorporating feedback, which helped refine the layout 
                        and ensured the final product was polished and met both project requirements and client expectations.
