                    and in all honesty quite boring. It was also quite short lived as I changed it to what it is now not too long after.

                    Also there is a little interactive touch, where the polaroids and dragonfruit moves if you hover over them.

                    The CSS and Javascript is all the same for the project pages, to keep the coheisive.

                <h3> And finally the design for my contact page, I thought it would be really fun to have this page be interactive aswel.
                    Thats why when you hover over the note it pops out. Kepping with the scrapbook theme  decided to make the envelop look like a real one
                    to make it feel like its stuck on the page.
